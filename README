NAME
    Task::Sub::Spec - Install all Sub::Spec modules

VERSION
    version 0.03

DESCRIPTION
    NOTICE: This module and the Sub::Spec standard is deprecated as of Jan
    2012. Rinci is the new specification to replace Sub::Spec, it is about
    95% compatible with Sub::Spec, but corrects a few issues and is more
    generic. "Perinci::*" is the Perl implementation for Rinci and many of
    its modules can handle existing Sub::Spec sub specs.

    This bundle is now installing Task::Perinci instead. Sub::Spec modules
    will be removed from CPAN in the future.
