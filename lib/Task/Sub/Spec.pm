Task::Sub::Spec - Install all Sub::Spec modules

=head1 VERSION

version 0.03

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTICE>: This module and the L<Sub::Spec> standard is deprecated as of Jan
2012. L<Rinci> is the new specification to replace Sub::Spec, it is about 95%
compatible with Sub::Spec, but corrects a few issues and is more generic.
C<Perinci::*> is the Perl implementation for Rinci and many of its modules can
handle existing Sub::Spec sub specs.

This bundle is now installing Task::Perinci instead. Sub::Spec modules will be
removed from CPAN in the future.
